# Things to keep in mind

## Spellbooks
1. We make it so spellbooks are only held in the main hand.
2. They will have similar durability (less overall) to ranged weapons, and durability degredation scales off of PER?
3. Whoever wields the spellbook gets a bonus +25% spell power modifier (based on its enchantment)
4. Spellbooks no longer fizzle up/Destroy itself and can be repaired with a scroll
5. Spellbooks scale harder off of int, lower int = less DMG. A base value of 8 INT required to gain more damage.

### Important Notes
Always export MODELS as SLAB. (Bottom Right under EXPORT. SLAB is in the center.)
```c++
if (x) {
    // CODE!
}
